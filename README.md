# Tic-Tac-Toe

> This is the third project on the Microverse Ruby Module. It is about creating a playable CLI Version of the game Tic-tac-toe for two players.

At the start of the game, you will be prompted to enter the name of player one. Player one will be the "X" symbol.
Then you will be prompted to enter the name of player two. Player two will be the "O" symbol.
Players take turns placing their respective symbols on a 3x3 grid. The first player to place 3 sequential symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
If neither one of the players manages to place 3 consecutive symbols the game ends in a draw.

The 3x3 grid is numbered from top-left to bottom-right with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 (a representation of the grid will be shown before you are prompted to chose).
To place your symbol on the grid just type the number that corresponds to the position in which you want to place the symbol, and then press enter.
